Goatse MBR
==========

A 512-byte bootloader displaying ASCII Goatse on boot.

The ``goatse.mbr`` bootloader can be generated by running ``make``.

QEMU

To test the bootloader you can run it in QEMU::

Bootable USB
============

Copy it onto your USB drive of choice using ``dd``. Please verify which block
device points to your USB using ``fdisk -l``, in the following example we
assume it's ``/dev/sdb``::

    dd if=goatse.mbr of=/dev/sdb bs=1 count=512
